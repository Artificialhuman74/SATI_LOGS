ABOUT CALL LOGS (TIPS) : 

warrant number: ATB736973
The call logs are information obtained from the internet service porviders (ISPs). Look for suspecious call timings (something that wont be possible normally.)

Dectective's tip: Seems like Aarav was trying to communicate something. Try noticing the 1st digit of the suspecious numbers. 

Dectective's tip: You are looking for a 3 number combination. Aarav might have included extra numbers. Try Eliminating numbers that dont seem from India
