<vishaldey@sati.edu.in> 
From: Dr. Vishal Dey
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Enough.
Aarav,
You’ve been warned before. There are areas even brilliant minds like yours shouldn’t trespass.
What you found on the Q-Net isn’t your concern. Shut it down. Delete it.
Walk away while you still can.
-- Dr.Dey



<vishaldey@sati.edu.in> 
From: Dr. Vishal Dey
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: What did you do?
Aarav,
Did you alter the backups again? My access logs are… wrong. Someone tampered with the ’13
incident logs. Was that you?
This isn’t clever anymore. You’re digging into things that could hurt people — including yourself.
Talk to me, kid. Please.
-- Dr. Dey

<arjunjain@sati.edu.in>
From: Principal Arjun Jain
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: RE: Bullying Complaint
Aarav,
I’ve reviewed your file. I don’t see any formal complaint submitted through the right channels.
You need to follow protocol, not send me encrypted logs and unverified names.
For your own good, focus on your academics.
-- A.J.

<arjunjain@sati.edu.in>
From: Principal Arjun Jain
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Last warning.
This is not a game. You’ve accessed systems you had no clearance for.
You are not an investigator.
Delete what you’ve found, or this goes far beyond school suspension.
-- A.J.


<sahilwad@sati.edu.in>
From: Sahil Wadhwa
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Bro what is this?
The file you sent me — it’s incomplete. And encrypted to hell.
Are you okay? You’re not replying.
Also… Deadpool/404’s node tripped last night. That shouldn’t be possible unless someone ran the
“Judgement Day” script.
That was your thing, not mine.
You still in?
-- Sahil.

<sahilwad@sati.edu.in>
From: Sahil Wadhwa
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Talk to me man
Aarav.
This is getting messed up. You’re acting like you're being watched.
You’re leaving stuff half-written. Half-uploaded.
You’re scaring me, man. What are you planning?-- Sahil.

<zoyabest@sati.edu.in>
From: Zoya Fernandez
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Aarav, talk to me.
You left that note in the compiler logs. “It wasn’t a virus. It was a mirror.”
What the hell does that mean?
Are you okay? Did someone threaten you again? I don’t know what game you're playing.
But if this is your idea of revenge or some dark genius arc — stop.
-- Zoya.


<zoyabest@sati.edu.in>
From: Zoya Fernandez
To: Aarav Khanna
Subject: Why me?
Aarav,
You’re shutting everyone out. But you still pinged me during the bot test last week.
Why are you leaving me these breadcrumbs? Why me?
Please just tell me what’s going on.
-- Zoya.

<aarav@sati.edu.in>
From: Aarav Khanna
To: Zoya Fernandez
Subject: Re: Why me?
Because you listened once.
And because you still might.
-- A.


<aarav@sati.edu.in>
From: Aarav Khanna
To: Zoya Fernandez
Subject: Re: Talk to me
The mirror reflects only what it’s given.
I gave them everything. They broke it.
Check the timestamps. Start from 03:16.
-- A.

Subject: IM RELYING ON YOU TO DECODE THIS!!!
“They locked me in,
But I left the KEY.
Not in code —
but in poetry.
Three letters long
